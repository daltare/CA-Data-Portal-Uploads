This document describes how OIMA staff at the California State Water Resources Control Board can manage users and permissions in the Water Board's organization on the [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/). These instructions assume that you are already a member of the Water Board's organizational account and have administrative rights for the account.

1.  Go to <https://data.ca.gov/> and click on the **Log in** button at the top right of the window to log in to your user account.

6.  On the **Add Member** page, you can add a member with an existing portal account by searching for an existing user (based on their username), or you can invite a new member by sending them an email invite. Select the user's access rights by selecting an option in the **Role** dropdown ('*Member*' can view private datasets but can't add or edit data; '*Editor*' can view private datasets and add/edit data; '*Admin*' can view private datasets, add/edit data, and manage organization members). When finished, click the **Add Member** button.
