This script automates the process of loading data from the [Waterboard's conservation portal](http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/conservation_portal/conservation_reporting.shtml) onto the [California Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-%E2%80%93-urban-water-supplier-monitoring-%E2%80%93-drinc). It pulls the most recent dataset from the Waterboard's site and checks to see if that dataset has already been loaded to the CA data portal. If not, it does a bit of reformatting (including renaming and reordering columns, replacing blanks with NAs, and inserting the PWSID codes), saves the reformatted dataset locally as a .csv file, and pushes the reformatted .csv file to the data.ca.gov portal.

To schedule the script to run automatically, edit the file `Call_Data_Portal_Upload_Script.R` to point to the location of the `Data_Portal_Upload_Automated.R` file on your computer, then schedule the task with the `Call_Data_Portal_Upload_Script.R` file. In Rstudio, you can create a task by going to the `Addins` menu, and selecting `Schedule R scripts on...` and selecting the `Call_Data_Portal_Upload_Script.R` then editing the time/date options. You can also check the status by going to the Windows Task Scheduler and clicking on the `Task Scheduler Library` on the left pane to verify that the task was created correctly.
