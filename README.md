These scripts automate the process of loading data from the [California Waterboard](http://www.waterboards.ca.gov) onto the [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/). They pull data from various sources, and do some minor cleaning and transformation prior to loading to the data portal as .csv files. The data is loaded to the portal via the [CKAN API](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/filestore.html#), using the [ckanr R package](https://github.com/ropensci/ckanr) (in particular the [resource_update](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ckanr/ckanr.pdf) function).
